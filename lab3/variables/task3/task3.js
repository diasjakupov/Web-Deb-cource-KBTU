const BIRTHDAY = '18.04.1982'; // make birthday uppercase?

const AGE = someCode(BIRTHDAY); // make age uppercase?


// Using uppercase for BIRTHDAY is acceptable, because it is a hard-coded constant that possibly never change.
//While AGE should be in lowercase as it is runtime variable, meaning that it is not constant and may change over time.
//Also it depends on the result of the function
